<h2>Interpreting a new programming language with CodeMirror<br/>Why &amp; How</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mapplz.com">MapPLZ</a> is a new programming language for interactive maps.
<br/>
For users to code in MapPLZ and see the Google Maps API respond, the site needed to parse and interpret the code on the client-side.
I used <a href="http://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a>, an open-source syntax highlighter and code editor, to help write an interpreter in a day.

<p>
I work on educational technology and online maps, but usually not together.
<br/>
Consensus is that children need to learn to code with blocks instead of text, or with commands that make lines and shapes.
You see this in the entertaining but not-so-practical code environments from
<a href="http://khanacademy.org/cs">Khan Academy CS</a>, <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>,
<a href="http://www.squeakland.org/">Etoys/Squeak</a>, and the classic Logo turtle.
</p>

<p>
Scratch and Etoys/Squeak were two of the learn-to-code activities which ship on the One Laptop per
Child (OLPC) laptop. The others are TurtleArt (Logo) and Pippy (Python). I taught OLPC classes in
Uganda, Uruguay, Haiti, and the Marshall Islands. No matter what animal icon we use to represent
computer code, it is still intimidating to a beginner!
</p>

<p>
The most convincing coding environment was Pippy (Python) because you can take a picture and
spin it. Or you can change some numbers and make the image shrink to a dot.
</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>
Following that logic, the best programming environment would be one that is <em>real world</em>.
Maps are real world. And unlike tangible code-ables such as robots, they are easy, fast, and cheap to make, share, and break.
</p>
<p>
I was tremendously inspired by Bret Victor's vision in his
<a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming">essay on Learnable Programming</a>.
In addition to supporting "live-coding" environments, Bret wants the IDE to make suggestions and
visualize what each control structure in the code does. I'm not at that point yet.
</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> first caught my eye because it supported C. I could add keywords to the library
and help users code <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduinos</a>. As you write, CodeMirror handles syntax highlighting
and showing when you're closing a parenthesis.
<br/>
I then wanted to add context-sensitive help. CodeMirror makes it easy to find the line number where your user is typing:
<br/><br/>
<span class="code">linenum = myCodeMirror.getCursor().line;</span>
<br/>
You can then get the text of that line using
<br/><br/>
<span class="code">myCodeMirror.getLine( linenum );</span>
<br/>
Scanning the line for keywords like "map" and "plz" was a good start to MapPLZ, but how do I know if the word "map" is used as a keyword or as part of a string?
CodeMirror's syntax highlighting makes it possible to look just at keywords ( I also use some jQuery here )
<br/><br/>
<span class="code">codelines = $(".CodeMirror-lines pre");</span>
<span class="code">for(var c=0;c&lt;codelines.length;c++){</span>
<span class="code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keywords = $(codelines[c], ".cm-keyword");</span>
<span class="code">}</span>
<br/>
Note that a cursor on Line 1 does not equal codelines[1]... there is an offset of a few empty &lt;pre&gt;s.
</p>
<p>
Looking at a variety of languages on MapPLZ.com, I decided to start with Ruby's syntax highlighting and added keywords. In Ruby,
most comments start with a #. I wanted comments to be written (inside parentheses) so I borrowed from another CodeMirror-supported language (JavaScript)
where /* and */ can begin and end a comment block. CodeMirror puts comments inside a span with class cm-comment, so now my interpreter can skip right over them.
</p>
<p>
With parentheses taken, I can't use the classic programming syntax
<br/><br/>
<span class="code">arbitaryFunctionName( MustBeFirstArgument, MustBeSecondArgument );</span>
<br/>
<strong>This is silly!</strong> How is a new programmer supposed to know the names, the order, that order matters, even where to find parentheses and semicolons on his/her keyboard?
<br/>
In mapping, you don't even need this type of function-parameter model. For example,
a marker with a popup has a location, a color, and some content. Unless we are being funny
and making a blue marker titled "red", a programming language should be smart enough to pick
out which is which. CodeMirror uses different classes to highlight strings and arrays, so I
just look for those in each line.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Geocoding</strong> - turning addresses into coordinates - is a hard problem which Google handles pretty well. This is why
I chose the Google Maps API over <a href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a>. Unfortunately,
this raises two problems. I need to differentiate a place ("MoMA in New York City") with a description
("The museum that I visited in New York City"). Until someone gives me a good NLP solution for this,
I decided to start locations with an @, and CodeMirror's Ruby syntax
puts them inside spans with class cm-variable-2. A line which has a cm-variable-2 and a cm-string is, therefore, a location-string instead of a string.
<br/><br/>
More difficult: callbacks. If you don't know about functions, much less callbacks or anonymous functions, <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-simple">geocoding looks hard</a>.
In MapPLZ, I still need to make geocoding calls asynchronously, but I can hide that from the user. I changed the code-interpreter to be recursive instead of a for loop, so it can return and not continue to the next
line until after I get a response from Google. This guarantees that when I reach a "plz" at the end of the marker, I have the matching coordinates and description for it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Running on Empty</strong> - if the user doesn't center the map themselves, the map will pan and zoom to fit any shapes which they've added to the map.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Scope</strong> is less complicated to write than I expected. I keep track of whether the user is inside a map, a marker/line/shape, or a button block. When a line says "plz", I jump back to the block above.
If you try to make a marker inside a marker, it will just use the last-defined location and description.
</p>
<p>
The complete JavaScript library which I use across the site to parse MapPLZ is most readable <a href="https://github.com/mapmeld/MapPLZ/blob/master/public/scripts/mapplz.js">on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h3>DB and Server</h3>
<p>
Programs are stored in a <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> graph database, so you can fork programs and build networks.
<br/>
The whole thing runs on <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> for no cost.
<br/>
I'm experimenting with <a href="http://www.mapplz.com/code-env/from/23">sample code and context-sensitive help</a> as you edit and write your own MapPLZ code.
